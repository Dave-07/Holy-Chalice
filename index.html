            <p>The Holy Grail is traditionally thought to be the cup that Jesus Christ drank from at the Last Supper and
              that Joseph of Arimathea used to collect Jesus’s blood at his crucifixion. From ancient legends to
              contemporary movies, the Holy Grail has been an object of mystery and fascination for centuries.
              From the knights of medieval legends to Indiana Jones, the holy grail has been the most sought-after
              Christian relic in popular culture for centuries. The grail is most commonly identified as the cup that
              Jesus drank from at the Last Supper and that Joseph of Arimathea used to collect Jesus’s blood when he was
              crucified.

              Given the importance of Jesus’s crucifixion and the eucharist in Christian beliefs, the search for the
              grail became the holiest of quests as it signified the pursuit of union with God.

              Scores of people have hunted for this sought-after Christian relic. But what makes the Holy Grail so
              significant and alluring?</p>
              <h3>Reference in literature</h3>
              <p>Possibly stemming from the presence of cauldrons and other mystical objects in Celtic mythologies, the grail became a common theme in literature related to King Arthur. French poet Chrétien de Troyes is credited with introducing the grail as a divine object in his early-12th century romance, “Perceval.” Around 1200, Robert de Boron further specified its Christian significance in his poem “Joseph d’Arimathie,” citing the holy grail’s origins at the Last Supper and Christ’s death. While Perceval was the knight destined to pursue the grail in Troyes’s and de Boron’s prose, it was Sir Galahad, introduced in the “Queste del Saint Graal” later in the mid-13th century, who became the most well-known knight of King Arthur’s court to complete the quest.</p>
            <h3>The Holy Grail and Medieval Legend</h3>
            <p>The Holy Grail became a popular theme in medieval literature, and stories about it were read and recited
              throughout Europe.

              Some Arthurian tales claimed that Joseph of Arimathea brought the Grail to Glastonbury in England. One
              legend has it that on the spot where he buried the Grail, the water runs red because it travels through
              Christ’s blood, though scientists agree this is just the effect of red iron oxide in the soil.

              Others believed the Knights Templar, a medieval order that protected pilgrims traveling to the Holy Land,
              seized the Holy Grail from the Temple Mount during the Crusades and secreted it away.

              The mythical literary figure, King Arthur, was said to coordinate great spiritual expeditions to search
              for the enigmatic relic. Legends hold that the Grail had the power to heal all wounds, deliver eternal
              youth and grant everlasting happiness.

              In one popular Arthurian story, a character known as the “Fisher King” had a serious wound that kept him
              from moving. He needed the Grail to be healed and could only sit and fish near his castle until someone
              found the magical cup.

              Since the inception of these widespread tales, countless travelers, scientists, historians and
              archeologists have attempted lofty quests to recover the Holy Grail.</p>
              <h3>Locations associated with the Holy Grail</h3>
              <p>In the modern era, a number of places have become associated with the Holy Grail. One of the most prominent is Glastonbury in Somerset, England. Glastonbury was associated with King Arthur and his resting place of Avalon by the 12th century. In the 13th century, a legend arose that Joseph of Arimathea was the founder of Glastonbury Abbey. Early accounts of Joseph at Glastonbury focus on his role as the evangelist of Britain rather than as the custodian of the Holy Grail, but from the 15th century, the Grail became a more prominent part of the legends surrounding Glastonbury. Interest in Glastonbury resurged in the late 19th century, inspired by renewed interest in the Arthurian legend and contemporary spiritual movements centered on ancient sacred sites. In the late 19th century, John Goodchild hid a glass bowl near Glastonbury; a group of his friends, including Wellesley Tudor Pole, retrieved the cup in 1906 and promoted it as the original Holy Grail. Glastonbury and its Holy Grail legend have since become a point of focus for various New Age and Neopagan groups.

                In the early 20th century, esoteric writers identified Montségur, a stronghold of the heretical Cathar sect in the 13th century, as the Grail castle. Similarly, the 14th-century Rosslyn Chapel in Midlothian, Scotland, became attached to the Grail legend in the mid-20th century when a succession of conspiracy books identified it as a secret hiding place of the Grail.</p>
            <h3>Recent Discovery</h3>
            <p>In March 2014, two Spanish historians claimed they discovered the Holy Grail at a church in León in
              northern Spain. They said the chalice had been there since the 11th century.

              Scientific dating confirmed that the cup was made between 200 B.C. and 50 A.D. The historians also
              presented data that included three years of research on the whereabouts of the Grail.

              Despite these convincing facts, there’s no way to know for sure that what the pair discovered is actually
              the true cup that Jesus drank from. Adding to the controversy is the fact that there are roughly 200
              alleged Grail cups in various locations around the world, and many scholars question whether the Holy
              Grail ever existed at all or is merely a legend.</p>
            <h3>Popular Culture and the Holy Grail</h3>
            <p>In recent years, the Holy Grail has appeared in many popular books and movies.

              Some of these films include Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975), Excalibur (1981), Indiana Jones and
              the Last Crusade (1989), and The Fisher King (1991).

              In Dan Brown’s popular novel, The Da Vinci Code, the Holy Grail isn’t described as an object but instead
              as Mary Magdalene’s womb. The book proposed that Mary gave birth to Jesus’s child, which started a
              bloodline of Christ.

              It is generally accepted as mythic, some believe the holy grail is more than just a figment of medieval literature. Some Arthurian tales claimed that Joseph of Arimathea brought the grail to Glastonbury in England. One legend has it that on the spot where he buried the grail, the water runs red because it runs through Christ’s blood, though scientists agree this is just the effect of red iron oxide in the soil. Others believe that the Knights Templar seized the holy grail from Temple Mount during the Crusades and secreted it away.

              Although scholars may never know whether the Holy Grail was an actual physical object or simply a mythical
              fantasy, the mysterious relic continues to fascinate millions even to this day.</p>
